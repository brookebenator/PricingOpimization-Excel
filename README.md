# PricingOpimization-Excel
In my MAR4524 - Consumer Demand with Big Data course, I learned how to optimize pricing products in many ways including pricing given demand, item bundles, complementary products, and substitute products.

# Sheet #1: Pricing Given Demand
This sheet showcases optimizing price to generate the highest profit. The information given is price, the demand at that price point, and the cost to make the product. Using statistical regression, I use a formula to determine the demand, revenue, cost, and profit for each price point. 

# Sheet #2: Pricing Complementary Products
This sheet showcases creating a pricing menu given two products that are complementary. Given the sales of the focal product, the prices of both the focal and other product, and the cost to manufacture both products, I use statistical regression to find the optimal price of the focal product given the price of the other product which is set by the manufacturer.
